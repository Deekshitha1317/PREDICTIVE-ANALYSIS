objective:this task focuses on performing predictive analysis using machine learning.. The primary objective is to build an accurate and efficient predictive model using various student-related features such as exam scores, attendance, study hours, gender, and more. The dataset used in this project consists of student records, where the target variable is the result (Pass or Fail).To complete this task first we have to choose a dataset.The dataset used for analysis is related to student academic performance dataset.And the target column is final_result.The tools and technologies are used in this task:python,pandas,numpy,sckit-learn,maplotlib,seabornand google collab.The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.After importing libraries we have to load our dataset. The entire workflow includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables), and splitting the data into training and testing set. Several machine learning models are explored in this project, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Classifiers. Among these, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance in terms of accuracy and overall classification metrics. Evaluation is carried out using confusion matrices and classification reports to understand model precision, recall, and F1-score.The results indicate that machine learning can be a powerful tool for predicting student outcomes. With an accuracy of approximately 85%, the model can help educators and administrators identify students at risk and provide timely interventions.
